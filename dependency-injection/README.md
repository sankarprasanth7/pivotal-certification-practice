## Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection with **@Autowired** annotation

- Constructor based dependency injection (Refer to **city.java**)
- Setter based dependency injection (Refer to **city2.java**)
- Field dependency Injection (Refer to **city3.java**)


Dependency injection using **Java configuration**

- With Java config approach, you donâ€™t put annotations into your business classes anymore. Instead, you write a separate Java configuration class to configure the dependency injection by instantiating the objects directly.
